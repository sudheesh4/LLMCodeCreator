Is it for children, adults, or both?\n* What features will the website have? Will it allow users to play against each other, or will it be a single-player game?\n* What level of difficulty will the game be? Will it be easy for beginners to learn, or will it be challenging for experienced players?\n* What kind of graphics and design will the website have? Will it be simple and minimalist, or will it be more complex and detailed?\n\nOnce we have a better understanding of the requirements, we can start to develop a plan for the website.\n\nIn the meantime, here is a clarifying question:\n\n* What is the desired level of difficulty for the game?", "result": "Based on the instruction and clarification, we can make the following assumptions:\n\n* The website will be used for entertainment purposes.\n* The target audience is adults.\n* The website will allow users to play against each other.\n* The game will be challenging for experienced players.\n* The website will have simple and minimalist graphics and design.\n* The desired level of difficulty for the game is medium to hard.\n\nThese assumptions can be refined and clarified as we learn more about the project."}
